# Forum Post Downloader
This script allows for downloading of posts and threads from the SimpCity forum

# Installation
1. install the tampermonkey browser extension
2. Copy the contents of https://github.com/SkyCloudDev/ForumPostDownloader/blob/main/ForumPostDownloader.user.js into a new script in Tampermonkey overwriting anything else and then save. 
3. If you want to allow .pdfs to be downloaded from within bunkr/cyberdrop albums in posts then you will need to add .pdf to tampermonkeys whitelist which can be found in Tampermonkeys settings. To do this first change config mode to 'Advanced' and then scroll down to downloads where you will see the whitelist, add a new line with .pdf and then click save.

# Updates
The script should automatically update from github, if it does not then just paste new versions into Tampermonkey replacing old versions.
